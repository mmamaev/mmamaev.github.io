Taking a train is the most efficient and convenient way of traveling across Great Britain, no matter what the distance is.  

I don't live in the UK but each time I visit the country I catch a train and go to places which I haven't seen yet. So far I've logged 85 rides along 29 different railway lines, from Exeter to Newcastle. On one particularly loaded day in January 2017, I managed to make eight journeys, although two of them being the result of catching a wrong train. 

With this kind of experience, I've got many tips and tricks to share. We'll begin with a practical overview of the British railway system in general. Then we will untangle the lore of ticketing - this knowledge will be your money saver. Next comes the art of advance planning - you'll learn how to save even more. Finally, we'll be going for a ride, and there are a few catches you might want to know.



National Rail network
---------------------

The rail network of Great Britain is called "National Rail". All National Rail stations feature the "crow's foot" logo; it also appears on tickets.

[National Rail](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/maps.aspx#official) includes most but not all passenger train services that run on the island.  Metropolitan networks such as London Tube, DLR, or TFL rail, and specialty services such as Heathrow Express or Eurostar, are not part of National Rail. You can distinguish them by their specific logos.  In this post we will focus on traveling across the country, so let's follow the crow's foot.

Under the hood, National Rail consists of about twenty companies that actually run trains and sell tickets. When you hear something like "a Thameslink service to Brighton", it means that this train to Brighton is run by a company called Thameslink.

Often you don't care about train operating companies. National Rail maintains the unified timetable and provides through ticketing across all the network. There is no need to deal with each train company separately. Yet in some cases you might want to know what company runs your train; we'll get to these in due time.

Types of trains
---------------

Usually, such factors as timing and price rather than the comfort of the carriage will define your choice of the train. Yet it might be useful to know what to expect on board.

There are many types of the rolling stock, from cramped grim rail-buses to bullet-shaped shiny high-speed trains. The more rural is the rail line, the more chances that you find yourself packed into one of the former.

On longer trips, especially on the main lines connecting major cities, you may expect the modern comforts. These include power outlets, on-board WiFi, a buffet or a trolley service, a dedicated bike storage.  

Not every train operator provides the entire range of the above. Sometimes power outlets are very scarce.  Sometimes WiFi is absent or not free of charge - you can find the details on [National Rail web site](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations_destinations/44866.aspx). For more information about the train's facilities, check the websites of individual train companies. However, even if a facility is listed available I wouldn't rely on it as the last resort for something important. Recharge your phone and get things done on the Internet before you board the train.

As a rule of thumb, the fleets of Virgin Trains, London North Eastern Trains, Southeastern High Speed, and Thameslink consist of the most comfortable trains.

On the other hand, with East Midlands Trains, West Midlands Railway, Northern, CrossCountry or ScotRail you are likely to find yourself on a rail-bus or a small cramped train. The fleets of the other companies are somewhat balanced between mainline trains and rural carriages.




First Class seating
-------------------

For a longer travel, when buying an Advance ticket well in advance you may get a very good bargain for the First Class. Yet before paying a premium for a First Class ticket, you would want to do some research to find out what exactly you're going to pay for.

My experience in the First Class is quite limited but, nevertheless, varied.

First Class of London North East Railway (former Virgin Trains East Coast) in a train to Durham was great. There was a dedicated First Class coach with broad comfy seats, both individual and paired. You get free WiFi, and a free meal (a sandwich, a cake, and a drink).

First Class of South Western was just ok. I found it at the end of the last car of the train en route from Salisbury to London. Seats were big and comfortable enough, but add-ons were nonexistent  (they advertise a free drink and a biscuit on selected trains only in the morning hours). WiFi is either available or not for all passengers, regardless of the class.

West Midlands Railway (former London Midland) provided the most underwhelming experience. I had been waiting for this train on the barren platform of Lichfield Trent Valley station. It was a freezing January night and I was looking forward to a relief in the ambiance of a First Class. What I found was a pass-through compartment in the middle of the train that looked and felt a Standard class: same seats, no add-ons. The only benefit of that First Class seating that I could conceive of was that this section was less crowded.

Note that many local trains do not offer First Class seating. 

Punctuality
-----------

National Rail maintains a [scoreboard](https://www.networkrail.co.uk/who-we-are/how-we-work/performance/public-performance-measure/) which track train punctuality by operator. 

As you can see, London North Eastern Railway (former Virgin Trains East Coast), while running very decent trains, has one of the worst scores. On average, 25% of their trains arrive more than 10 minutes late. Precisely so! I can't help wondering at that mysterious, haunted signal north of Newcastle that kept failing every second time I took a southbound Virgin train, year after year. 

My personal statistics is taken across 13 train operators whose services I have used. It appears that exactly 10% of the journeys have failed to complete within 10 minutes of the scheduled arrival. The worst non-disruptive delay I experienced was about thirty minutes (southbound Virgin East Coast, of course). This is why I advise allowing at least half an hour for a connection involving a long distance train even if your trip on that train will be short. 

By "non-disruptive" I mean that the railway, in general, is maintaining normal operation. Once a suspicious item had been found at Canterbury East station, and my train was terminated on an intermediate station. I was diverted on to a long uninspiring tour over Kent missing my appointment in Canterbury. You cannot plan for such incidents. This is the subject of your Disaster Recovery protocols rather than the normal schedule.

Time and length of travel
-------------------------

Try avoiding rush hours when masses commute to or from work, especially in the morning. In the case of Britain, this clich√© advice is bolstered by an explicit economic incentive: tickets are cheaper if you set off after 9 AM.

On working days, traveling from London in the morning and returning in the afternoon is an anti-pattern, so the train should not be crowded. However, at weekend it is vice versa.

It is unlikely that even your longest journey takes more than four and a half hours. For your reference, I've made a map which shows travel times from London to other cities by fastest train.

![Travel times map](/images/uk/rail/travel_times_map.png)
*Travel times from London by fastest train*

Just for the fun of the thing, the longest direct service I could find is Penzance to Glasgow. It takes 11 hours 47 minutes to do the full length of the route via Bristol, Birmingham, York, Newcastle, and Edinburgh. Ironically, the direct train is not the fastest. You will make it to Glasgow in ten hours if you change trains on the way.  

There are also two sleeper trains from London, one going to Penzance and the other fanning out to several destinations in Scotland. You could take these for the sake of the experience, yet the same destinations are reachable within the daylight hours in a significantly shorter time frame.
