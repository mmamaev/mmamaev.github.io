The purpose of this publication is to help travellers plan their trips.


### Why you are here

You are going to explore some part of the world to see things. 

Your time away is precious. Either you have carved out a few spare days during your business trip, or this is your hard-earned vacation - you have to get the most out of it. You want spend your time enjoying attractions instead of looking for them and sorting out issues of transportation, ticketing, lodging, and so on.

The key to success is being prepared. You are willing to do some homework to draw up a plan. You need information.


### What I do for you

I give systematic reviews of travel-related infrastructures and facilities. You can use these as how-to guides and checklists. 

I also write about attracttions themselves when there is something you should know in order to get to (or through) the attraction or better understand it.

I try to get my posts organized, informed, and comprehensive. Random impressions do not guide my writing. I write about places (countries) that I've had a lot of experience with.
